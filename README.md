# MATLAB-VIBRATION
This repository has files with MATLAB codes dealing with system analysis of position of single degree vibration systems.
Q1 - The 15 kg oscillator contains an unbalanced motor whose speed is N rpm as shown in Fig. 1. The stiffness of the spring k = 1100 N/m. The oscillator is also restrained by a viscous damper whose piston is resisted by a force of 50 N when moving at a speed of 0.6 m/s. Determine,
(a) The viscous damping factor
(b) Plot the magnification factor for motor speeds from 0 to 350 rpm
(c) The maximum value of the magnification factor and the corresponding motor speed.

Q2 - Write a MATLAB script file that computes the response of a single degree of freedom under damped system shown in Fig. 2 to initial excitations. Use the program to determine and plot the response for the following data: Initial conditions: 
x (0) = 0, ùë•Ãá(0) = v0 = 30 cm./sec,
œân = 6 rad/s, and Œæ = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.30.
where A and œï represent the amplitude and phase angle of the response respectively

Q3 - Write a MATLAB script to obtain the motion of the mass subjected to the initial condition. There is no external forcing function acting on the system. The single degree of freedom system is shown in Fig. 3 and the parameters are given as m = 3 kg, k = 6 N/m, and C = 5 N-s/m. The displacement of the mass is measured from the equilibrium position and at t = 0, x(0) = 0.04 m and ùë•Ãá(0) = 0.10 m/s. 

Q5- For the mechanical vibrating system shown in Fig. 5, using MATLAB assume that m = 3 kg, k1 = 15 N/m, k = 25 N/m, and c = 10 N-s/m. Plot the response curve x(t) versus t when the mass m is pulled slightly downward and the initial conditions are x(0) = 0.05 m and ùë•Ãá = 0.8 m/s.
